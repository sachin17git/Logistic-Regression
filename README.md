# Logistic-Regression

## This dataset contains information of users in a social network. So this social network has business clients which can put their ads on the social network, and one of their clients is a car company who as launched their brand new luxury SUV for a ridiculous price. We should predict whether the user bought the SUV are not. I have built a logistic regression model to make prediction.
